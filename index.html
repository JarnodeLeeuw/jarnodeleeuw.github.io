<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><img id="pic" src="Jarno-foto.jpg" alt="Jarno" width="150" height="150"></p>
<br>
<p>My name is Jarno de Leeuw. At the moment I'm writing this I'm an 18 year old computer science student at DaVinci college Dordrecht.
I was born on the 18th of august in the year 1998, in the Albert Schweitzer hospital in Dordrecht. </p>
<br>

<h2>My hobbies</h2>
<p>In my spare time I usually play video games with my friends, or just hang out with them. Riding around on my scooter is something I really enjoy as well, same goes for skateboarding, which I'm trying to pick up again after a 4 year break.
I also enjoy racing, I've been to a few go-kart tracks and always manage to overtake many others.</p>
<br>

<h2>Current programming skills</h2>
<p>At the moment I'm writing this I just barely begun my education, and am very much a beginner when it comes to programming.
Up until now I only know a bit about HTML, CSS and Git, very basic, but I'm getting there.</p>
<br>

<h2>Ambitions and goals</h2>
<p>Considering I don't know a lot about programming yet, I intend to get a bit of information about the different programming languages first, and then decide which one I want to focus on. When I think about what I want as my job right now my answer would be that I'm not sure. Most things I'm interested in are in other countries, which is why I wrote this in English, so it's legible in not just the Netherlands. Something I'm thinking about lately when it comes to work is being a cyber crime detective, using my computer and programming skills to solve crime. Having just said that, I am still young, and could still change my mind about that, maybe when I'm further into my education my goals will have changed to something like a game designer for Valve.</p>
<br>

<h2>Previous schools and education</h2>
<p>The first school I went to was de Meridiaan in Dordrecht. After that I went to Yulius Het Tij, a VMBO (Advanced intermediate professional education), which I graduated from 3 years ago. I stayed at that school to follow the new HAVO (Higher general advanced education) classes they were just starting, and I dropped out of that after 2 years.</p>
<br>

<h2>Work experience</h2>
<p>Up until now I've only had 1 job, as a part of the delivery crew for <a href="https://www.dominos.nl/?gclid=Cj0KEQjwo5--BRCS8ceLjv-XppUBEiQAGp15ELI9dDRuUdZsb-It6FXi8g6srZKC4aw7CVUULfolqksaAtcs8P8HAQ">Domino's Pizza Dordrecht</a>.</p>
