<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><img src="Jarno foto.jpg"></p>
<p>My name is Jarno de Leeuw. At the moment I'm writing this I'm an 18 year old computer science student at DaVinci college Dordrecht.
I was born on the 18th of august in the year 1998, in the Albert Schweitzer hospital in Dordrecht. </p>


<h2>My hobbies</h2>
<p>In my spare time I usually play video games with my friends, or just hang out with them.
I also enjoy racing, I've been to a few go-kart tracks and always manage to overtake many others.</p>


<h3>Current programming skills</h3>
<p>At the moment I'm writing this I just barely begun my education, and am very much a beginner when it comes to programming.</p>


<h4>Previous schools and education</h4>
<p>The first real school I went to was de Meridiaan in Dordrecht. After that I went to Yulius Het Tij, a VMBO (Advanced intermediate professional education), which I graduated from 3 years ago. I stayed at that school to follow the new HAVO (Higher general advanced education) classes they were just starting, and I dropped out of that after 2 years.</p>


<h5>Work experience</h5>
<p>Up until now I've only had 1 job, as a part of the delivery crew for Domino's Pizza Dordrecht.</p>
